My main areas of interest include:

- Frontend development, particularly with React and design systems

- Open source contributions
- Personal growth and productivity

On open source side, I contribute to several projects:

Contributor:

Core maintainer:

- [arco design](https://github.com/arco-design)
- [react-figma](https://github.com/react-figmaact-figma)

I'm currently passionate about building user-friendly web applications and exploring the potential of decentralized technologies. Let's BUIDL and HODL!
