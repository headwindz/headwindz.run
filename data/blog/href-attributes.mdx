summary: An anchor element with an empty `href` attribute will cause the page to reload when clicked
---

Frontend developers are all familiar with [the anchor element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a). I recently struggled with a bug which took me a while to figure out. The root cause is an unexpected use of `href` attribute.

> href: Contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink points to. URLs are not restricted to Web (HTTP)-based documents, but can use any protocol supported by the browser.

# Context

I was building a multi-level menus with the following requirements:

- Only the leaf menu item is an active link
- Clicking other non-leaf menu items should expand the next level items

# What I did

It comes in handy for making each menu item with `<a>`. The only difference between leaf menu items and non-leaf menu items is that leaf menu items should have valid `href` which indicates the redirection destination. Therefore, I build a `MenuItem` component like this:

```tsx
function MenuItem({ link, title, onClick = () => {} }) {
  return (
    <a href={link} onClick={onClick}>
      {title}
    </a>
  )
}
```

# The Problem

## Leaf menu items ✅

Leaf menu items work fine as the source `{ link: '/aaa', title: 'abc'}` would be rendered as `<a href='/aaa'> abc </a>`

## Non-leaf menu items ❌

For non-leaf menu items, the source `{ link: '', title: 'abc', onClick: console.log }` would be rendered as `<a href> abc </a>`. Clicking such an anchor link will reload the page. This is a result of the fact that the current page is assumed to be the value of `href` attribute if the `href` attribute exists but no value is set for it. i.e.

```tsx
<a href>aa</a>
```

is equivalent to

```tsx
<a href={{location.href}}>aa</a>
```

# Solutions

There are two possible solutions to work around this issue

- Don't set href if link is exceptional

In this case, anchor element is used for semantic purpose only. The `onClick` handler will take care of the interaction.

```tsx
function MenuItem({ link, title, onClick = () => {} }) {
  if (link) {
    return (
      <a href={link} onClick={onClick}>
        {title}
      </a>
    )
  }
  return <a onClick={onClick}>{title}</a>
}
```

- Reset link to # if link is exceptional

```tsx
function MenuItem({ link, title, onClick = () => {} }) {
  if (!link) {
    link = '#'
  }
  return (
    <a href={link} onClick={onClick}>
      {title}
    </a>
  )
}
```

# Conclusion

To concludes, an anchor element with an empty `href` attribute will cause the page to reload when clicked. Having this knowledge in mind may save you time when you get into a similar track.
